# Webpack

Basic starter configuration for any project with React + Webpack + Babel.
We will need to install node_modules to run the aplication.
We also need to set the server (Express) and serve the static content  with app.use (static). 
Our static files are in the dist directory.
Server configuration is not included in this project.
Remeber to use the command "webpack" in console each time you want to see the changes.
